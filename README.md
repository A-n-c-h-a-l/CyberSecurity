# Beginner Mini-Projects in Cybersecurity
As an absolute beginner in cybersecurity who has attempted some easy Capture-The-Flags (CTFs) challenges and TryHackMe labs, I decided to complete some easy cybersecurity projects to gain some hands-on experience.

Since this repository is a collection of several mini-projects, each directory represents a standalone project that are meant to perform a particular task. Mini-projects range from defensive to offensive cybersecurity, and cover a variety of fundamental concepts such as computer networking, cryptography, exploits, and more.
